Andrew Hamilton's mangle product; docs at

Changed Makefile to allow evilmake to define its own stuff, and to
not compile "rotate" which depends on starlink (yuck).

Removed the "A" files since they are silly and unnecessary and screw
up the MacOS CVS stuff.

Changed msg.c to use evilmake UNAME values SunOS and Linux

Take out defn of CC=gcc and rely on evilmake to set it

Added mrb_balkanize, and changed Makefile for it

moved *polygons[NPOLYSMAX] defn outside the stack for the main
programs
