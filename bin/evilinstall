# Script to install a version of a code and declare it current.
#
# The version name should either be "cvs" or begin with the letter "c".
# If it is "cvs", then simply check-out the current (untagged) version
#   of the code, build it, copy it into a "cvs" subdirectory, and
#   declare it current.
# If it is an actual tagged version, then cvs-export that version,
#   build it, install it using UPS, and declare it current.
# If the requested version of the code already exists, then simply declare
#   that version current.
#
# If you are installing products with inter-dependencies, be sure to
# install them in the order of those dependencies.  For example, since
# "idlspec2d" depends upon "idlutils", you would install them with:
#   % evilinstall idlutils v4_5_0
#   % evilinstall idlspec2d v4_5_0
#
# This script requires the "ups" product.  It will try to build code and
# install it using the utilities in the "sdsstools" product.  If those do
# not exist, then it tries using the "evilmake" and "install_ups_table"
# scripts in the "idlutils" product.
#
# Note: This script tries to set-up products using the table file in the /ups
# subdirectory of the product.  I can't say with certainty that it works
# w/out that table file.
