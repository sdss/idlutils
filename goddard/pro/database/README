/database                                                May, 1997

This subdirectory contains the IDL procedures, mostly written by Don Lindler,
(ACC/Goddard) to create and access an IDL database.   These database procedures
are currently used by the ASTRO-UIT, HST-GHRS, HST-STIS, ALEXIS and SOHO 
science teams.  The LaTex file DATABASE.TEX in the /text directory describes 
the use of the database procedures with an emphasis on astronomical 
applications.     Further information on the database software is available 
in Chapter 3 and Appendix J of "A User's Guide to the GHRS Software" available
as a postscript file or as .html help from 
http://hrssun.gsfc.nasa.gov/daf/sw_docs.html

The database procedures require the non-standard system variables
!PRIV, !TEXTOUT, and !TEXTUNIT.   These can be added to the IDL session 
using the procedure ASTROLIB.

Sample astronomical catalogs, formatted as IDL databases, are available in the
/zdbase directory.   These include the Yale Bright Star Catalog, the 
RC3 Galaxy catalog, and a catalog of HST observations.

Due to a bug in the procedures DB_ENT2EXT and DBENT2HOST prior to August 1995,
databases created with the /IEEE keyword on non-IEEE machines did not properly
format multiple-valued items.   A procedure DBREPAIR is available from 
Wayne Landsman (landsman@mpb.gsfc.nasa.gov) which can fix improperly 
created databases.
