           T_GETPSF - Now stores (in PSF_CODE) the ID of PSF stars in order used

16-Mar-96: TBINFO,HCONGRID,HROT - removed call to SINCE_VERSION()

14-Mar-96: UNZOOM_XY - Convert from window coordinates to image array coords
           ZOOM_XY - Convert from image array coordinates to window coords
           CURVAL, TVLIST now call UNZOOM_XY, have OFFSET and ZOOM keywords

13-Mar-96: NSTAR - Fixed PRINT='filename' option

11-Mar-96: LEGEND - Now accepts scalar-valued keywords
           IMF() - Exponent value forced to be at least floating point
           TRAPZD - Always compute TOTAL() in double precision

07-Mar-96: STRD - Added GROUP, PAR keywords, call PICKFILE

06-Mar-96: PROB_KS - Typo corrected in probability computation
	   Did not affect numeric result, but sometimes required more iterations
	   than necessary
	    
           KSTWO - Use floating point computation for effective number of points

04-Mar-96: Removed FITSRD, FITSWRT, DFITSRD, DFITSWRT and associated 
           procedures from the Library
           Use the FITS I/O and STSDAS I/O packages for general conversion 
           between FITS and STSDAS formats.

	   ST_DISKREAD - Read a disk FITS file from the Hubble Space Telescope
		and reconstruct an STSDAS (GEIS) file
